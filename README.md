# 🎓 Student Performance Indicator – ML Project

A complete end-to-end machine learning project designed to **analyze and predict student academic performance** using demographic and academic features. This project demonstrates how data science can be applied in the education sector to enhance decision-making, identify at-risk students, and improve overall academic outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Predict student performance using historical academic and personal data
- Analyze key factors influencing academic outcomes
- Build a modular ML pipeline for efficient training and evaluation
- Apply proper **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, and **model tuning**

---

## 🔎 ML Workflow (CRISP-DM Inspired)

1. **Business Understanding**
   - Aim: Predict performance to guide support/intervention strategies

2. **Data Understanding**
   - Analyzed distributions, correlations, and missing values

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Outlier handling (IQR), encoding, feature scaling, and cleaning

4. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers tested

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Logging, Custom Exceptions (for modular code structure)

---

> This modular design supports **scalability**, **debugging**, and **deployment-readiness**.

## 📈 Key Insights from EDA

- Student's Performance is related with lunch, race, parental level education
- Females lead in pass percentage and also are top-scorers
- Student's Performance is not much related with test preparation course
- Finishing preparation course is benefitial.
---

## ✅ Project Highlights

- Implemented complete **ML lifecycle** (except deployment).
- Structured code using **OOP and modular design patterns**.
- Included **logging** and **exception handling** for robustness.
- Created clean, reusable **training and prediction pipelines**.
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV (optional).

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit
- Add SHAP for feature importance interpretability
- Include time-series analysis if longitudinal data is available
